----3-Tier Architecture on AWS-----

This project demonstrates the implementation of a 3-Tier Architecture using various AWS services. The architecture separates the presentation, application, and database layers, enhancing scalability, manageability, and security. This README provides an overview of the project, the AWS services used, and instructions for setup and deployment.
